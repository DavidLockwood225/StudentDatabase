Student Management Project

-My end of semester project is a Windows Forms app that stores, displays, and maintains information about students and their academic career. 

-Information stored ranges from personal identifying information, such as the studentâ€™s name and date of birth, to scholastic career information, such as degree major and grade point average.

-Other information, such as status of scholarships or hours currently scheduled, is also contained in the database and available to the application.

-This application is intended to assist the administration process by providing reports on the students attending the college. 

-Reports will contain information regarding student origins, area of study, age, time attended, etc.
